File Step 1 - Create Matrix - 231124v4.R Preparation of a data matrix file containing consumption data of the UK 64+ population from NDNS, weighted
File Step 2 - Create Model.Rv4 (002).R Creates a model table to apply apply 'optimisation_v2022-05-04.R' to produce an optimised diet based on the selected idetary constraints
FILE input_data3.R The original optimisation file to create the model table used to apply 'optimisation_v2022-05-04.R' to produce an optimised diet based on the selected idetary constraints
